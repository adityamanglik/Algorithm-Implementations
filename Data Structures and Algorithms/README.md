# Algorithm Implementations

I implemented the following data structures as part of the [Data Structures course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/) :

## Priority Queue
## Heap - Min and Max
## Disjoint Set - Rank by Union and Path Compression
## Rabin-Karp Algorithm - String pattern matching via Hashing
## AVL Tree - Balanced BST
## Splay Tree - Fast lookups for recently accessed data
