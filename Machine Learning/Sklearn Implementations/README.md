[Course URL](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)

These are my code implementations for all machine learning models covered in the Machine Learning course on Udemy. I completed this course during the _Corona virus_ lockdown in March 2020.

It's a great course and introduced me to the world of machine learning in a top-down manner.
